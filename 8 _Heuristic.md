- Heuristic refers to the technique designed to solve a problem quickly.
- Kind of guess work
- Rather than exploring every node, we go the node with the **minimum Heuristic** at the same level.
- To find Heuristic value any of the following method can be used:
  * Eucledian Distance
    * Calculate the distance between two node points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
  * Manhattan Distance
    * Used to find verical/horizontal distance, eg. 8 Puzzle Problem.
    * *PS: In 8 Puzzle Problem, another method of finding Heuristic value can be finding the number of missing tiles for each node.*
