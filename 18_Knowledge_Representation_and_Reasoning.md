- **Knowledge** is the skills gained through experience.
- **Intelligence** is to use that knowledge.
- **Reasoning** is the processing of knowledge.
- Now, our main goal is to put these 3 factors in the machines.
- The machine acts in the way the knowledge is represented.
- There are various methods to represent the knowledge:
  - **Logic** 
    * Propositional logic (true/false)
    * Predicate logic (quantifiers such as for_all, there_exists etc are used)
  - **Rules**
    * if/then
  - **Semantic Net**
    * Making a meaningful graph representing all the relationships between the objects
    * eg. Google Graph
  - **Frames**
    * Slots(i.e., objects) and Fillers(i.e., attributes)
    * Fixed structure in which data is entered using which machine takes any decision
  - **Script**
