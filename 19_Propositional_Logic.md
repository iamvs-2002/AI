- One of the simplest method of knowledge representation.
- **Output is either true or false, not both.**
  * 1+1=2 : True proposition
  * 1+1=3 : False proposition
  * Some students are intelligent : True/False => Not a propositional logic
- Errors:
  * Syntax Error(grammatical error)
    * Two types of propositions:
      * Atomic(single sentence)
      * Complex/Composite(multiple sentences making a single proposition)
        * 5 symbols/operators are used:
          * Negation(¬)
            * NOT the case
            * P = Today is NOT Monday.
            * ¬P
          * Disjunction(∨)
            * OR
            * You should study(P) OR eat at a time(Q).
            * P∨Q
          * Conjunction(∧)
            * AND
            * I am going to Delhi(P) AND then to Agra(Q).
            * P∧Q
          * If/then(→)
            * If it rains today(P), roads will be wet(Q).
            * P→Q
          * Iff(↔)
            * You can get a discount(P) only if you are a new customer(Q).
            * P↔Q
        * Example:
          * You can access the internet(P) only if you are a CSE student(Q) or a freshman(R).
          * P↔Q∨R
  * Semantic Error
