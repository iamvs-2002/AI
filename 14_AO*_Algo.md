- Based on AND/OR Graph.
- Works on the basis of Problem Decomposition(breakdown of complex problem into smaller problems).
- Informed Searh Technique.
- A* always gives the optimal solution while AO* does not explore all the solution paths once it gets the solution.
- Example:
  *                          A
  *             6B     x    12C        10D
  *          5G   7H                 4E   4F
  * Here, x represents the hyper edge(B and C) and 6,12 etc are the heuristic values(estimation values)
