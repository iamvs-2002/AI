- Uninformed Search Technique, i.e., we do not have any domain specific knowledge.
- Based on FIFO(first-in-first-out) eg. Queue
- Also called as Level Search Technique because it moves level by level.
- Shallowest node
- Complete
- Optimal solution is guaranteed.
- Time complexity
- Example:


    *                           A                       level - 0
    *                 B         C        D              level - 1
    *           E     F      G    H      I              level - 2
    *      I    K            L           M              level - 3
    *           N                                       level - 4
