- Uninformed Search is called as Blind Search / Brute Force Method.
- Here, we have no prior knowledge, i.e., we search without any information.
- Here we explore all the states and then we compare if the result is equal to the goal state, if yes, we stop else continue exploring.
- Exponential time, O(b^d)
