- Agent can be anything: a human, a program or a machine.
- Operations performed by an agent:
  * It percepts the environment through the sensors.
  * Then based on the perceptions, it takes some actions with the help of Agent Programs.
  * Agent Programs are used to decide the action by relating it to some past event.
  * The output is called as Actuator and is given through the Effectors.
  * This output causes some change in the environment.
  * Agent -> Percept -> Decision(Agent Program) -> Actions(Output)
- 
- Goals:
  * High Performance
  * Optimized Result
  * Rational Action
-   
- Factors behind the model of any agent:
  * **P** : Performace
    * eg. It should ensure safety, comfortness etc.
  * **E** : Environment
  * **A** : Actions
  * **S** : Sensors
- 
- Types of Agents:
  * **Simple Reflex Agents**
    * Acts only on the basis of current perception.
    * Takes immediate action without any calculation.
    * Ignores the rest of the percept history(knowledge gained in the past).
    * **Based on If/then rules => condition statements.**
    * Environment should be fully observable(agent should be knowledgeable about the whole environment).
    * Environment -> Percept(through sensors) -> Current Situation(of environment) -> If/then(condition) -> Action -> Change in Environment
  * **Model Based Reflex Agents**
  * **Goal Based Agents**
  * **Utility Based Agents**
  * **Learning Agents**
