- Here, we talk about only those games which are based on a well defined logic and rules, and not on the luck factor.
- That is, the games we can talk about is Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Checkers etc.
- Two major algorithms:
  * Minimax Algorithm
  * Alpha-Beta(α-β) Pruning
- All the possible choices are shown by Game Tree/Search Tree/Space Graph.
- Played according to the concept of Max/Min, i.e., the opponent player tries to minimize the probability of our win while we try to maximize it.
- On the basis of utility(payoff, i.e., +1 or -1 in the score), we find the working of the above two algorithms.
- BFS or DFS can be applied on the Space Graph but in that case the number of possibilities/nodes/choices will increase and hence the searching will be more difficult
- In Space Graph, depth is called as ply.
