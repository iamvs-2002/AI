- **Lotfi Zadeh** is the father of Fuzzy Logic.
- Fuzzy Logic is a super set of Boolean Logic(0/1)(immediate transition).
- PS: Boolean logic fails when we have to represent a function/logic in continuous form.
- Represent uncertainty, i.e., where there are concrete values.
- Represent with degree.
- Fuzzy logic provides us the flexibility between the transition from one state to another.
- Fuzzy logic is more appropriate way to represent the data as compared to Boolean Logic.
