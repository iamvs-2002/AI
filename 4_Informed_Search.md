- Here, we have prior knowledge, hence we search with information.
- In informed search, we use the concept of Heuristics.
- Here we try to find quick solutions.
- Less time, space complexity.
- Optimal solution might be compromised.
- Example: A* algorithm, Heuristic DFS


**Heuristics are used only when the uninformed searching takes exponential time, i.e., in case of a non-polynomial problem.**

For example, In case of Travelling Salesman Problem, we use nearest neighbour method to find the heuristic value for each node.
