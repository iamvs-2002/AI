- Bidirectional Search is an extension of BFS or DFS.
- Two simultaneous search from an initial node to goal and backward to from goal to initial, stopping when two meet.


- Example:



  
  *               2                   7
  *     1(start)      4     5     6      9(goal)
  *               3                   8

- Example: If we have to reach 9th node, i.e. "goal", then we will start either BFS or DFS from 1 to 9 and simultaneously from 9 to 1
